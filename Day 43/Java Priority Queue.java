/*  Input Format-

The first line contains an integer,n , describing the total number of events. Each of the n subsequent lines will be of the following two forms:

ENTER name CGPA id: The student to be inserted into the priority queue.
SERVED: The highest priority student in the queue was served.
The locked stub code in the editor reads the input and tests the correctness of the Student and Priorities classes implementation.

Output Format

The locked stub code prints the names of the students yet to be served in the priority order. If there are no such student, then the code prints EMPTY.

Sample Input 0

12
ENTER John 3.75 50
ENTER Mark 3.8 24
ENTER Shafaet 3.7 35
SERVED
SERVED
ENTER Samiha 3.85 36
SERVED
ENTER Ashley 3.9 42
ENTER Maria 3.6 46
ENTER Anik 3.95 49
ENTER Dan 3.95 50
SERVED
Sample Output 0

Dan
Ashley
Shafaet
Maria
Explanation 0

In this case, the number of events is 12. Let the name of the queue be Q.

John is added to Q. So, it contains (John, 3.75, 50).
Mark is added to Q. So, it contains (John, 3.75, 50) and (Mark, 3.8, 24).
Shafaet is added to Q. So, it contains (John, 3.75, 50), (Mark, 3.8, 24), and (Shafaet, 3.7, 35).
Mark is served as he has the highest CGPA. So, Q contains (John, 3.75, 50) and (Shafaet, 3.7, 35).
John is served next as he has the highest CGPA. So, Q contains (Shafaet, 3.7, 35).
Samiha is added to Q. So, it contains (Shafaet, 3.7, 35) and (Samiha, 3.85, 36).
Samiha is served as she has the highest CGPA. So, Q contains (Shafaet, 3.7, 35).
Now, four more students are added to Q. So, it contains (Shafaet, 3.7, 35), (Ashley, 3.9, 42), (Maria, 3.6, 46), (Anik, 3.95, 49), and (Dan, 3.95, 50).
Anik is served because though both Anil and Dan have the highest CGPA but Anik comes first when sorted in alphabetic order. So, Q contains (Dan, 3.95, 50), (Ashley, 3.9, 42), (Shafaet, 3.7, 35), and (Maria, 3.6, 46).
As all events are completed, the name of each of the remaining students is printed on a new line.
